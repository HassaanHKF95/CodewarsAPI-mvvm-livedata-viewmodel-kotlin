# Simplest MVVM Architecture | LiveData | ViewModel |Retrofit2 | Navigation component | Kotlin and more

This repository contains Android Architecture Components i.e MVVM, LiveData, ViewModel, Navigation component with Retrofit2 for consuming rest API.

## About this Project

In this project we will build a <b>Codewars Challenges</b> listing app using android architecture components ( **LiveData** and **ViewModel** ) using **MVVM** pattern with the help of **Retrofit2** for consuming rest API data from <a href="https://dev.codewars.com/#introduction">Codewars API</a>.

## App Features
Here's the simple App that shows list of Codewar Challenges(dummy API's response) in **RecyclerView** with the details of each item of list on separate screen(**fragments**).
